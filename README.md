# HFT Profitability - Exploratory Analysis

There are two folders:
 BTC for Bitcoin analysis across multiple exchanges
 SPY for the S&P 500 ETF on the NASDAQ exchange

The process was reconstruction of the order book from trade data, followed by simulations.

The BTC order book was reconstructed from millisecond-resolution tick data from Kaiko.

The SPY order book data was reconstructed from nanosecond-resolution ITCH data from NASDAQ. It is copied into this repo for convenience. The original ITCH file is several gigabytes in size.
